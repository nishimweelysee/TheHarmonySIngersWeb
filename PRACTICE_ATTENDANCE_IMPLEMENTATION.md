## Overview

The Choir Practice Attendance System has been successfully implemented for The Harmony Singers Choir. This comprehensive system allows administrators to schedule practice sessions, track attendance for all active singers, and automatically send reminder notifications at optimal times.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Practice Session Management

-   **Create Practice Sessions**: Schedule new choir practice sessions with title, description, date, time, venue, and notes
-   **Edit Sessions**: Modify existing practice session details
-   **Session Status**: Track session status (scheduled, in_progress, completed, cancelled)
-   **Automatic Singer Addition**: All active singers are automatically added to attendance lists when sessions are created

### 2. Attendance Tracking

-   **Attendance Status**: Mark singers as Present, Absent, Late, or Excused
-   **Reason Tracking**: Record reasons for absences or lateness
-   **Additional Notes**: Add specific notes for individual singers
-   **Quick Actions**: Bulk actions to mark all present/absent or clear reasons
-   **Export Functionality**: Export attendance data to CSV format

### 3. Automated Reminder System

-   **Smart Timing**: Sends reminders at optimal intervals:
    -   1 day before practice
    -   Morning of practice day
    -   30 minutes before practice starts
-   **Multi-Channel Delivery**: Email notifications with THS branding
-   **Automatic Scheduling**: Console command runs every minute to check for sessions needing reminders
-   **Prevention of Duplicates**: System tracks sent reminders to avoid spam

### 4. Comprehensive Dashboard Integration
